This is helpful if you want to check if you are on the right track even if you are not done with the whole assignment. Be sure to remember to delete the comment afterwards!\n\n- Avoid using global variables unless you absolutely have to. The grader tests your code in an isolated environment without running all cells from the top. As a result, global variables may be unavailable when scoring your submission. Global variables that are meant to be used will be defined in UPPERCASE.\n\n- To submit your notebook, save it and then click on the blue submit button at the beginning of the page.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport base64\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf","metadata":{"deletable":false,"id":"ZpztRwBouwYp","tags":["graded"],"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-28T20:44:42.390413Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-28T20:44:42.390694Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-28T20:44:58.418384Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-28T20:44:42.390666Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-28T20:44:58.417286Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import unittests","metadata":{"deletable":false},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Load and inspect the data\n\nBegin by loading the data.

The reason for this \nis that commonly you will use 3-dimensional arrays (without counting the batch dimension) to represent image data. The third dimension represents the color using RGB (Red, Green and Blue) values. This data might be in black and white format so the third dimension doesn't really add any additional information for the classification process but it is a good practice regardless.\n\n- Normalize the pixel values so that these are values between 0 and 1. You can achieve this by dividing every value in the array by the maximum pixel value.\n\nRemember that these tensors are of type `numpy.ndarray` so you can use functions like [reshape](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html) or [divide](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.divide.html) to complete the `reshape_and_normalize` function below.
