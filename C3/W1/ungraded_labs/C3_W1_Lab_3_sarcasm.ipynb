This will result in a [ragged tensor](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/ragged_tensor) which simply means a tensor with variable-length elements. The sequences will indeed have different lengths after removing the zeroes, thus you will need the ragged tensor to contain them.\n\n* Like before, you will use the layer's `adapt()` method to generate a vocabulary.\n\n* Then, you will apply the layer to the string sentences to generate the integer sequences. As mentioned, this will not be post-padded.\n\n* Lastly, you will pass this ragged tensor to the [pad_sequences()](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/utils/pad_sequences) function to
