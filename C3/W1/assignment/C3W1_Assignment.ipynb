In this assignment you will be working with a variation of the [BBC News Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/learn-ai-bbc/overview), which contains 2225 examples of news articles with their respective categories.\n\n\n#### TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL GRADING OF YOUR ASSIGNMENT:\n- All cells are frozen except for the ones where you need to submit your solutions or when explicitly mentioned you can interact with it.\n\n- You can add new cells to experiment but these will be omitted by the grader, so don't rely on newly created cells to host your solution code, use the provided places for this.\n- You can add the comment # grade-up-to-here in any graded cell to signal the grader that it must only evaluate up to that point. This is helpful if you want to check if you are on the right track even if you are not done with the whole assignment. Be sure to remember to delete the comment afterwards!\n- Avoid using global variables unless you absolutely have to. The grader tests your code in an isolated environment without running all cells from the top. As a result, global variables may be unavailable when scoring your submission. Global variables that are meant to be used will be defined in UPPERCASE.\n- To submit your notebook, save it and then click on the blue submit button at the beginning of the page.\n\n\nLet's get started!","metadata":{}},{"id":"18e757f2","cell_type":"code","source":"import csv\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"deletable":false,"id":"zrZevCPJ92HG","outputId":"4ba10d10-1433-42fc-dc8e-83b297705cfe","tags":["graded"],"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-04T19:26:31.489940Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-04T19:26:31.490343Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-04T19:26:31.495025Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-04T19:26:31.490313Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-04T19:26:31.493703Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":3},{"id":"48119af8-9469-420c-acb6-d57f03e1f20a","cell_type":"code","source":"# import unittests","metadata":{"deletable":false,"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-04T18:26:05.700377Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-04T18:26:05.700713Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-04T18:26:05.704946Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-04T18:26:05.700687Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-04T18:26:05.703820Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":7},{"id":"f2ee7f84","cell_type":"markdown","source":"Begin by looking at the structure of the csv that contains the data:","metadata":{}},{"id":"ffae3497","cell_type":"code","source":"with open(\"/kaggle/input/bbc-news-classification/BBC News Train.csv\", 'r') as csvfile:\n    print(f\"First line (header) looks like this:\\n\\n{csvfile.readline()}\")\n    print(f\"Each data point looks like this:\\n\\n{csvfile.readline()}\")","metadata":{"deletable":false,"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-04T18:26:07.054567Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-04T18:26:07.054934Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-04T18:26:07.068224Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-04T18:26:07.054906Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-04T18:26:07.067201Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"First line (header) looks like this:\n\nArticleId,Text,Category\n\nEach data point looks like this:\n\n1833,worldcom ex-boss launches defence lawyers defending former worldcom chief bernie ebbers against a battery of fraud charges have called a company whistleblower as their first witness.  cynthia cooper  worldcom s ex-head of internal accounting  alerted directors to irregular accounting practices at the us telecoms giant in 2002. her warnings led to the collapse of the firm following the discovery of an $11bn (Â£5.7bn) accounting fraud. mr ebbers has pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud and conspiracy.  prosecution lawyers have argued that mr ebbers orchestrated a series of accounting tricks at worldcom  ordering employees to hide expenses and inflate revenues to meet wall street earnings estimates. but ms cooper  who now runs her own consulting business  told a jury in new york on wednesday that external auditors arthur andersen had approved worldcom s accounting in early 2001 and 2002. she said andersen had given a  green light  to the procedures and practices used by worldcom. mr ebber s lawyers have said he was unaware of the fraud  arguing that auditors did not alert him to any problems.  ms cooper also said that during shareholder meetings mr ebbers often passed over technical questions to the company s finance chief  giving only  brief  answers himself. the prosecution s star witness  former worldcom financial chief scott sullivan  has said that mr ebbers ordered accounting adjustments at the firm  telling him to  hit our books . however  ms cooper said mr sullivan had not mentioned  anything uncomfortable  about worldcom s accounting during a 2001 audit committee meeting. mr ebbers could face a jail sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing. worldcom emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2004  and is now known as mci. last week  mci agreed to a buyout by verizon communications in a deal valued at $6.75bn.,business\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":8},{"id":"1624e420","cell_type":"markdown","source":"As you can see, each data point is composed of the category of the news article followed by a comma and then the actual text of the article.","metadata":{}},{"id":"28e9d216","cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Exercise 1: parse_data_from_file\n\nThe csv is a very common format to store data and you will probably encounter it many times so it is good to be comfortable with it. Your first exercise will be to read the data from the raw csv file so you can analyze it and built models around it. To do so, complete the `parse_data_from_file` function below. \n\nSince this format is so common there are a lot of ways to deal with this files using python, both using the standard library or third party libraries such as [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). Because of this the implementation details are entirely up to you, **the only requirement is that your function returns the `sentences` and `labels` as regular python lists**.\n\n**Hints**:\n- Remember the file contains headers so take this into consideration.\n\n\n- If you are unfamiliar with  libraries such as pandas or numpy and you prefer to use python's standard library, take a look at [`csv.reader`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader), which lets you iterate over the lines of a csv file. \n- You can use the [`read_csv`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) function from the pandas library.\n- You can use the [`loadtxt`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html) function from the numpy library.\n- If you use any of the two latter approaches remember you still need to convert the `sentences` and `labels` to regular python lists, so take a look at the docs to see how it can be done.\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"fd40ca26","cell_type":"code","source":"# GRADED FUNCTION: parse_data_from_file\n\ndef parse_data_from_file(filename):\n    \"\"\"\n    Extracts sentences and labels from a CSV file\n    \n    Args:\n        filename (str): path to the CSV file\n    \n    Returns:\n        (list[str], list[str]): tuple containing lists of sentences and labels\n    \"\"\"\n    sentences = []\n    labels = []\n\n    ### START CODE HERE ###\n    df = pd.read_csv(filename, skiprows=1, names=[\"ArticleId\", \"Text\",\"Category\"])\n    for _, row in df.iterrows():\n        sentences.append(row['Text'])\n        labels.append(row['Category'])\n\n    ### END CODE HERE ###\n\n    return sentences, labels","metadata":{"deletable":false,"tags":["graded"],"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-04T19:32:40.443737Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-04T19:32:40.444143Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-04T19:32:40.449908Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-04T19:32:40.444115Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-04T19:32:40.448673Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":8},{"id":"e2c9a86e","cell_type":"code","source":"# Get sentences and labels as python lists\nsentences, labels = parse_data_from_file(\"/kaggle/input/bbc-news-classification/BBC News Train.csv\")\n\nprint(f\"There are {len(sentences)} sentences in the dataset.\\n\")\nprint(f\"First sentence has {len(sentences[0].split())} words.\\n\")\nprint(f\"There are {len(labels)} labels in the dataset.\\n\")\nprint(f\"The first 5 labels are {labels[:5]}\\n\\n\")","metadata":{"deletable":false,"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-04T19:32:42.284477Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-04T19:32:42.284809Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-04T19:32:42.429380Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-04T19:32:42.284786Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-04T19:32:42.428196Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"There are 1490 sentences in the dataset.\n\nFirst sentence has 301 words.\n\nThere are 1490 labels in the dataset.\n\nThe first 5 labels are ['business', 'business', 'business', 'tech', 'business']\n\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":9},{"id":"1f2bf934","cell_type":"markdown","source":"***Expected Output:***\n```\nThere are 2225 sentences in the dataset.\n\nFirst sentence has 737 words.\n\nThere are 2225 labels in the dataset.\n\nThe first 5 labels are ['tech', 'business', 'sport', 'sport', 'entertainment']\n\n```","metadata":{}},{"id":"f6ad47d2","cell_type":"code","source":"# Test your code!\n# unittests.test_parse_data_from_file(parse_data_from_file)","metadata":{"deletable":false},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"id":"2db58b95","cell_type":"markdown","source":"**An important note:**\n\nAt this point you typically would convert your data into a `tf.data.Dataset` (alternatively you could have used [tf.data.experimental.CsvDataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/CsvDataset) to do this directly but since this is an experimental feature it is better to avoid when possible) but for this assignment you will keep working with the data as regular python lists. \n\nThe reason behind this is that by using a `tf.data.Dataset` some parts of this assignment will be much more difficult (in particular the next exercise), because when dealing with tensors you need to take additional considerations that you don't need to when dealing with lists and since this is the first assignment of the course, it is best to keep things simple.

In theory you could also use `tf.keras.layers.TextVectorization` layer here but it provides a lot of extra functionality that is not required so it ends up being overkill. `tf.keras.layers.StringLookup` is able to perform the job just fine and it is much simpler.\n\n**Hints:**\n- Since all of the texts have their corresponding labels you need to ensure that the vocabulary does not include the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) token since that is not a valid label.","metadata":{}},{"id":"aa48558a","cell_type":"code","source":"# GRADED FUNCTION: fit_label_encoder\n\ndef fit_label_encoder(labels):\n    \"\"\"\n    Tokenizes the labels\n    \n    Args:\n        labels (list[str]): labels to tokenize\n    \n    Returns:\n        tf.keras.layers.StringLookup: adapted encoder for labels\n    \"\"\"\n    ### START CODE HERE ###\n    \n    # Instantiate the StringLookup layer.
